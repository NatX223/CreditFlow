CreditFlow: Trust is the New Collateral
CreditFlow is a decentralized credit protocol on Creditcoin 3.0 that replaces 150% over-collateralization with social trust.

The Core Idea
In standard DeFi, you need wealth to borrow wealth. CreditFlow allows humans and AI agents to borrow against their reputation instead of their assets.

Social Vouching: Backers (humans or agents) vouch for you by staking CTC, lowering your collateral requirement through collective trust.

Automated Garnishing: The protocol monitors incoming revenue and automatically directs a percentage toward debt repayment, making loans self-servicing.

Universal Reputation: Repayment data is recorded on the Creditcoin L1, creating a portable, 300-900 credit score that travels across the ecosystem.

Why Creditcoin 3.0?
CreditFlow utilizes Universal Smart Contracts (USC) to trustlessly verify revenue and vouches across different chains. This turns Creditcoin into the global credit bureau for the agentic economy, providing a secure layer for machine-to-machine and human-to-machine trust.
